## [Unreleased]

### Fixes

- Ship the modules the packaged daemon actually imports: `lib/api-revision.mjs`, `lib/tray/shell.mjs`, `lib/warp/split-tunnel.mjs`, `lib/warp/status-listener.mjs`, plus `daemon-ready.mjs`, `tray-shell-cli.mjs`, and `tray-warp-action.py`. The installed `.deb` failed at startup with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
- Add `npm run test:packaging`, which derives the required file set from the code and fails when `stage-payload.sh` misses one
- Green up Plane M CI: the proxy-launcher XDG tests asserted Linux-only behaviour on macOS and Windows, where `listDesktopApps()` returns `[]` by design, so every OS had been failing since July
- Reject cross-site writes on every mutating route (`Sec-Fetch-Site`, `Origin`, and a required `application/json` content type), so a hostile page can no longer drive `warp-cli`, systemd, or the user's config through the loopback daemon
- Run `systemctl --user` and `pkill` off the event loop — a hung user manager could block every SSE subscriber and health check for the length of the timeout
- Fix tray autostart never starting: the generated entry carried `Hidden=true`, which in an autostart directory means "ignore this entry" (`systemd-xdg-autostart-generator` logs "not generating unit, entry is hidden")
- Keep `tray.autostart` as a remembered preference instead of forcing it off when Cloudflare One Client is selected, so it survives a switch there and back
- Report `active` and `effective` from `POST /api/config/tray-autostart` rather than a bare `ok` for a preference that changes nothing today
- Re-evaluate notification ownership when the desktop app or `ui.notifications` changes, instead of freezing it at daemon startup
- Stop a scripted or piped re-install from resetting the user's desktop-app choice (`sync-tray-autostart --if-unset`)
- Close the ThirdFlare tray and panel before restarting the daemon they talk to, so switching to Cloudflare One Client no longer leaves an open panel showing a connection error
- Do not swap the running shell twice when saving from the native settings dialog — the daemon already does it, and the second pass could leave two Cloudflare tray icons
- Skip the live shell swap on non-Linux instead of falling through to the ThirdFlare branch and running `pkill`/`spawn` there

- Keep the ThirdFlare Web UI off while Cloudflare One Client is the desktop app — the daemon now starts API-only on that path
- Turn the Web UI back off when switching from the ThirdFlare One tray to Cloudflare One Client, unless `webui.enabled` is set
- Leave `warp-desktop-svc` unit management to the host under Flatpak instead of writing a unit systemd never reads
- Let Cloudflare One Client own status notifications while it is active, so one WARP transition no longer notifies twice
- Detect a running `warp-desktop-svc` by command line — `pgrep -x` never matched its 16-character process name, so the fallback could start a second copy
- Report WARP status from the active desktop app in `thirdflare-one-tray --status`
- Start `warp-taskbar` from the user's home so its `.sentry-native/` cache no longer lands in the ThirdFlare install tree
- Sandbox `HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in the suites that spawn the daemon — `npm run test:all` was rewriting the developer's real `~/.config/thirdflare/config.json` and deleting their real tray autostart entry
- Thread `env` through `describeTrayShell` into `detectCloudflareGui`, so Flatpak detection reads the caller's environment instead of the sandbox
- Re-enable `warp-desktop-svc.service` on uninstall when ThirdFlare had taken over the desktop app, so Cloudflare One Client keeps its background service
- Scope `--force-thirdflare` to the session: stop only the Cloudflare tray icon, leave `warp-desktop-svc` running, and put the icon back if the ThirdFlare tray fails to start

### Documentation

- Publish VitePress docs to GitHub Pages (install, CLI, API, guides, packaging)
- Rewrite docs homepage hero: plain-language copy, correct default port (4173), simple vs expert UI, opt-in kill switch
- Refresh docs hero for app routing, WARP internals page, and 0.2.7 capability map
- Fix docs site port drift (4173) and snapshot paths for split tunnel examples
- Add docs/WARP_INTERNALS.md (warp-cli modes, warp-docker reference)
- Add UI controls smoke test for expert-mode toggles, segmented controls, and app routing picker

### Features

- Document every mutating route in `openapi/thirdflare-api.json`, including `POST /api/config/tray-autostart` and the shared `403` cross-site response
- Desktop app switch: default to host Cloudflare One Client tray, or ThirdFlare One’s PyQt6 tray (`tray.shell`, `POST /api/config/tray-shell`, install `--shell`)
- Run `warp-desktop-svc` from a ThirdFlare-managed systemd user unit when the WARP package ships none (`~/.config/systemd/user/thirdflare-warp-desktop-svc.service`)
- Launch `warp-taskbar` and `warp-desktop-svc` on the host through `flatpak-spawn --host` when ThirdFlare One runs under Flatpak
- Report `warp-taskbar` and `warp-desktop-svc` state in `thirdflare-one-tray --check`
- Linux native shell: PyQt6 tray + embedded Web UI with Cloudflare One Client–style simple layout (`/?shell=1`) and expert-mode toggle
- Native PyQt6 system settings (`thirdflare-one-tray --settings`) for Web UI enable, HTTP port, desktop app, tray autostart, and notifications
- Web UI startup modes: API-only by default (`--no-open`, systemd); `--daemon` serves full static UI with no runtime disable toggle
- Persist Web UI and server settings via `POST /api/config/webui`, `POST /api/config/server`, and `POST /api/config/ui`
- First-class tray packaging: stage tray Python modules, `/usr/bin/thirdflare-one-tray`, PyQt6 recommends in deb/rpm/Fedora spec
- Polkit-scoped kill switch: `thirdflare-nft-apply` helper + `com.thirdflare.one.policy`; GET `/api/killswitch` stays unprivileged
- Opt-in tray autostart (`tray.autostart` config + `POST /api/config/tray-autostart`)
- Always On (Linux) UX: kill switch labeled as Windows Always On equivalent in UI and docs
- Recognize warp-cli `WarpProxy on port …` Mode string for app routing UI (see docs/WARP_INTERNALS.md)
- Split tunnel in-app guide (IP/domain routing vs per-app limitations)
- Scenario-driven routing UX: Split Tunnel status banner, three setup cards (Exclude / Include / Local proxy), removable route lists, Tunnel proxy guide, and simple Connectivity entry point
- Structured `splitTunnel` snapshot from `lib/warp/split-tunnel.mjs` for live mode and route counts

### Bug Fixes

- Share one `warp-cli --listen status` process per daemon (SSE + notifications); fixes leaked listener processes on UI reconnect
- Web UI: eliminate half-enabled 503 state; tray starts `--daemon` with full static serving; KDE Settings desktop entry
- App routing: recognize real warp-cli Mode string `WarpProxy on port 40000` so the app picker appears after enabling local proxy
- KDE launcher: single app menu entry launches native PyQt6 tray (not Firefox); removed Desktop Actions that Plasma indexed as duplicates
- Stale daemon detection: restart API server after install or when `apiRevision`/version mismatch (fixes “Unknown API route” on Settings toggles)
