# Split tunnel & app routing

ThirdFlare One exposes warp-cli split tunnel reads/actions via API and UI, plus **desktop app shortcuts** for local proxy routing.

## Split tunnel API

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/query/splitTunnelDump
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/query/splitTunnelIps
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/action/resetSplitIps
```

Host/route lists follow warp-cli semantics.

## Local proxy mode

When local proxy is enabled, apps can be launched through a SOCKS/HTTP proxy without system-wide VPN routing.

The UI **Enable local proxy** action:

1. Turns on proxy settings via API
2. Opens the Console tab for visibility
3. Offers `.desktop` shortcuts for common apps (`lib/apps/proxy-launcher.mjs`)

## Copy & UX

User-facing strings use plain language — workarounds over vendor limitation lectures. App routing is presented as actionable steps, not policy disclaimers.

## Tests

- `scripts/ci-split-tunnel.test.mjs`
- `scripts/ci-proxy-launcher.test.mjs`
